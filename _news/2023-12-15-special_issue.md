📢 Do you have any interesting results about applying machine learning methods to fatigue modelling? 
I am serving as guest editor for the special issue on "Machine Learning for Fatigue Design" in Applied Sciences (MDPI) with Prof. Davide Paolino and Prof. Andrea Tridello. 
We look forward to receiving your research paper or review article about hashtag#machinelearning for hashtag#fatigue to make this SI a comprehensive collection of scientific insight and findings.
