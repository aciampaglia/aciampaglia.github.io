My research focuses on the modeling and monitoring of composite structures with physic-informed data-driven methods.

My objective is to understand the mechanical response of composite materials from high-fidelity experiments across different scales, from micro to meso to macro. Covering all the aspects from the laboratory to the FEM model, I develop methodologies to transfrom data into knowledge to foster the spread of composite materials. The result of this research will be a data-driven framework for the characterization of composite materials from limited high fidelity experiments guided by the estimated uncertainty.
